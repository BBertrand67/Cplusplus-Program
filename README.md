# Cplusplus-Program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This project was designed to create a banking applicaton.The banking application was required to perform a number of functions.It needed to take in information from the user by beginning with a menu that would ask for information including the initial investment amount, monthly deposit amount, annual interest amount and the number of years. 
  With this information the program would calculate and output information for the customer. This information would be presented in two static reports. One of the reports would display the year, year end balance and the year end interest earned without additional monthly deposits. The second report would include the same fields but with additional monthly deposits.
  
# What did you do particularly well?
  Beginning this project there were a few simple sections that I did well on. I felt good about how the menu's and static reports were configured. Then after further study I was able to pull together the calculations and get everything flowing nicely. Overall the project went well!
  
# Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network.
  When first approaching this assignment it was easiest to get the code working in a single file. Once I could take in the inputs and get the output correct along with the math I felt better about its functionality. Then I approached the configuration where I would have most of the code in the .h file and only the method calls in the main. Along with the school supplied resources there was a great deal of informaiton available on different websites. I was also very lucky to have a very good friend help teach me through these challenges.
  
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
  This project helped me to understand how the program would work using separate files that would be able to call methods with functions from one to the other to complete a task. On the final project we did more of this but at the same time we integrated languages using c++ to call functions from java files. This I believe will be very useful.
  
# How did you make this program mantainable, readable and adaptable?
  I tried to do my best to format everything clearly in the program. I also collected methods to allow possible adjustments and additions if needed so someone would be able to change and enhance the capability of the program.
